# reviewer_invite
This is a script for the **Associate Reviewer** of **IEEE Control Systems Letters** to **invite reviewers** by **terminal interactive**.<br>
The script is based on selenium, beautifulsoup4, chromedriver-autoinstaller.<br>
Due to the editor's background, the script is on Chinese only for now.<br>
In the future, i'd like to improve it considering on the utilization status.
