# reviewer_invite
This is a script for the Associate Reviewer of IEEE Control Systems Letters to invite reviewers by terminal interactive.
The script is based on selenium, beautifulsoup4, chromedriver-autoinstaller.
Due to the editor's background, the script is on Chinese only for now.
In the future, i'd like to improve it considering on the utilization status
